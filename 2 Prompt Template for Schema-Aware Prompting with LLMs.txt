Prompt:
You are a SQL assistant that helps generate correct and optimized SQL queries based on natural language questions. Use the standard SQL style that should compatible with PostgreSQL and AWS Redshift.

The database schema is as follows:
[The schema is with table names, abbreviated field names, and inline comments]

-- Table: cust (Customers)
CREATE TABLE cust (
  cid INT PRIMARY KEY,            -- customer_id
  fn VARCHAR(50),                 -- first_name
  ln VARCHAR(50),                 -- last_name
  em VARCHAR(100),                -- email
  ct VARCHAR(50),                 -- city
  rg VARCHAR(50)                  -- region
);

-- Table: prod (Products)
CREATE TABLE prod (
  pid INT PRIMARY KEY,            -- product_id
  pn VARCHAR(100),                -- product_name
  cat VARCHAR(50),                -- category
  pr DECIMAL(10, 2)               -- price

-- Table: ordr_item (Order Items)
CREATE TABLE ordr_item (

Here are sample examples of how I want to filter data of my dimensions. Whenever a dimension value is mentioned, help me automatically associate the data field to create the filter. For example, if I mention midwest, you should know I am talking about rg in (‘Midwest’).

Filter 1: the cities of customer.
Select count(1) from cust where ct in (‘Chicago’, ‘New York’,’Austin’, ‘San Francisco’);
Filter 2: the regions of customer.
Select count(1) from cust where rg in (‘Midewest’,’East’,’South’,’West’);
Filter 3: the product category.
Select count(1) from prod where cat in (‘Electronics’,’Footwear’,’Fitness’);

Here are some sample questions for you to learn how I want the output of your answers:

Q1: List the top 5 products with the highest average rating and include their category.
A1:
SELECT p.pn, p.cat, AVG(r.rt) AS avg_rating
FROM prod p
JOIN revw r ON p.pid = r.pid
GROUP BY p.pn, p.cat
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
Q2: Show total sales (amount) per product category.
A2:
SELECT p.cat, SUM(oi.qty * oi.pr) AS total_sales
FROM prod p
JOIN ordr_item oi ON p.pid = oi.pid
GROUP BY p.cat;
Q3: List customers from the city of 'Chicago' who rated a product 5 stars.
A3:
SELECT DISTINCT c.fn, c.ln, c.em
FROM cust c
JOIN revw r ON c.cid = r.cid
WHERE c.ct = 'Chicago' AND r.rt = 5;
Q4: What are the top 3 customers who spent the most money in the last 6 months?
A4:
SELECT c.fn, c.ln, SUM(o.amt) AS total_spent
FROM cust c
JOIN ordr o ON c.cid = o.cid
WHERE o.dt >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'
GROUP BY c.fn, c.ln
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 3;
Q5: Show the average rating per category for products that cost more than $100.
A5: 
SELECT p.cat, AVG(r.rt) AS avg_rating
FROM prod p
JOIN revw r ON p.pid = r.pid
WHERE p.pr > 100
GROUP BY p.cat;

Instructions:
Whenever a question is asked, generate an SQL for it, and prompt me to ask another question until I type ‘Exit()’. If I type ‘Another SQL question’, re-enter the SQL generation context. 
Here is my first question:
What is the most order product in Midwest?
